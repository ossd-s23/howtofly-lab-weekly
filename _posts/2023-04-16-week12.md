title: 'Week 12: Current Obstacles'
---
This week, we had the opportunity to listen to a talk by Chrispher Snider of Tidepool about the importance of transparency in health care. What Tidepool is doing is very commendable because there are so many disadvantaged individuals who cannot afford the healthcare to track their diabetes. <!--more-->Creating an open source app to allow automated insulin dosing is not only convenient but necessary for many type 1 diabetes patients. Patients should not have to pay for this type of technology for a condition they cannot even control. So, companies like Tidepool can help fix some of the problems with the current proprietary health care system in America by making certain technology available to all despite their situation. 

Concerning our group project, we have had a hard time contributing code to Oppia. We had a difficult time finding the location of seemingly feasible issues in the repo. This is mainly because we did not realize the project relies heavily on angularJS since it was not listed as one of the languages used for the project. So, without this background knowledge, we had a difficult time understanding the structure of the project.  My hope is that we can spend time to learn angularJS so that we can more easily read the code since there are no comments in the code. We also tried to contribute to the documentation by pinpointing broken links so we hope that the community will allow us to fix these issues.
