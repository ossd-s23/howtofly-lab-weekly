title: 'Week 15: Farewell'
---

This week in class, we began presentations. My favorite presentation so far was MAPLE. I felt that they were very clear and thorough. I thought it was interesting that their first task for MAPLE was to create a flyer.<!--more--> You would think that initially you would be assigned to a bug or small feature request, so I thought they had one of the more unique introductions with their project. I also enjoyed JARVIS’s presentation. All of their contributions seemed very practical but significant such as changing JARVIS’s text color from dark blue to white in dark mode so that the text is more visible. 

Concerning our own presentation, though I was quite nervous, I feel proud of myself and my group for delivering a concise presentation. I feel like there are some parts I could have explained better but overall I’m satisfied with the presentation.  

I feel sad writing this final blog knowing it’s the end of a class that I actually genuinely enjoyed and learned so much from, even more so since I'm graduating. Because of my genuine interest in the class, this will not be the end of my contributions to projects that I choose in the future. Farewell OSSD, it's been fun :‘)
