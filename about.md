I am a soon to be graduating senior in May this year, 2023. Throughout my experience in college, I have gained knowledge in multiple programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and C/C++. I hope to use these skills to better my experience in Open Source Software Development.

On my downtime, I enjoy drawing portraits of people. I quite enjoy the amount of detail it requires to draw the human face.
